<h1>TIC TAC TOE</h1>
My first android application that i've created i.e., a a tic tac toe game.
I have used simple button that will take the value either 0 or X and the player who will make a line of three points or a diagonal of three points (either o or X) will win the game. If no one won, then the game will reset and if any of the player wons then a toast message will be displayed that this player has won the game.
